            <img src="./images/post2.jpg" alt="Holiday Emptiness Cover" class="article-cover"> 
            <p>Late July, my family country house, somewhere in Puglia, Italy. Laying on the floor of my bedroom, I hear the crickets chirping in the distance. It is too hot to do anything but lay down at that time of the day. I let my mind wander, in hope of finding something to do, but cannot figure out anything. This feeling of lethargy and boredom truly belongs to summer to me. Indeed, the three months of summer vacation are necessary partially filled with emptiness: no obligation to attend to but nothing to do. I do believe, however, that this feeling is deeply tied to the concept of rest. In order to come back ready for a new school or work year in September, one must accept the emptiness to some extent during the summer. Here are however some tips to embrace it without wasting your time away completely.</p>

            <h2>Developing mental strength</h2>
            <p>Embracing inactivity can be harsh after a professionally and personally intense year. However, I believe it can become a new way of strengthening one’s mind, by accepting the potentially repressed flow of thoughts and emotions, for once. I often find myself more anxious than usual at the beginning of summer, because the limited activities do not let me escape my own mind. However, by the end of summer, I start feeling more at peace than I was during the previous year, because that empty time has allowed me to come at peace with the issues I’ve dealt with. I often end up feeling grateful for that summer mental space, as it leaves me energised and calmer inside than before.</p>

            <h2>Expanding competence span</h2>
            <p>Summer has always been a super creative period for me. During the school or work year, I often have to let go of most of my creative hobbies, to focus more on daily activities. Coding, for instance, has always been a passion of mine; but outside of summer, I never seem to find time to learn more about it and build new projects. The same goes for creative writing: inspiration just seems to come way more easily during those long afternoons in Italy than elsewhere. I believe the easiest way to ensure one’s summer does not end up being “too empty” is by setting clear goals and habits to keep up with during the summer months at the beginning of June and assessing progress every month or so.</p>

            <h2>Inducing creative thinking through boredom</h2>
            <p>As my parents always said, boredom is the mother to creativity. By accepting the inactivity and letting your mind wander, innovative ideas can spur and flourish. Therefore, I strongly recommend going into summer with intent to get creative. Being off of daily activities can only be beneficial to our overstimulated modern brains, and help us develop new ideas and rethink our habits.</p>

            <img src="./images/post3.jpg" alt="Is Veganism Compatible with Athletics Cover" class="article-cover"> <!-- Cover Image for Article 3 -->
            <p>I’m an avid runner and a member of my university rowing team. I always look for ways to enhance my sport performances and optimize my physical health. A few months ago I decided to do something that I never thought I would: become a vegan for real. This idea came to me after finding out that some athletes at Paris Olympics were vegans...</p>
            <h2>Hitting my protein goals was harder than I thought</h2>
            <p>One thing about being a vegan that hit me first is how hard it is to get enough proteins compared to eating meat, dairy products or eggs. As athletes we always depend on them as our sources of energy and also quick recovery after strenuous exercises especially thus switching plant-based proteins like in beans, lentils, tofu and quinoa has been so difficult...</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits on sleep and recovery</h2>
            <p>However, within several weeks after this initial fight with protein, there were some unexpected positive changes that started taking place in my body. One of the greatest surprises was that I slept much better than before...</p>

            <h2>Training myself to Think Ahead</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, I recognized that becoming a vegan athlete takes more forethought than the usual diet. You cannot eat whatever is available and hope it will give you enough energy for your performance...</p>

            <h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, after a few weeks of experimenting with a vegan diet, it is quite possible to combine being an athlete and veganism. Nonetheless, you must be more conscious about it and plan better than if you were following the usual omnivorous diet...</p>
